- We looked at the employees that we can grow to become the next generation to create a mentorship program for eligible employees. 
- Unfortuently, HP only has little over 1.5K eligible employees- there will be a rush of hiring in the upcoming future

All the analysis is performed via SQL code

## Summary

- HP needs to fill over 90K roles
- HP needs to seriously focus on recruiting to add more mentoring ready employees
- In order to evaluate the shortages, we need to see what departments and roles the mentorship-eligible employees work in - we need to pull additional queries to evaluate the gaps
- HP will also need to take a look at the the overall employee base to see what fraction of overall employees are retiring soon, to really understan the impact.

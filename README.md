# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
SQL Project

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Analysis of the employer base of Pewlett-Hackard to evaluate how many of the current employees will retire in the near future, and to set up a mentorship program for the next generation of employees.

## Analysis

- HP is expecting a loss of over 90K employees to the upcoming "silver tsunami"
- Majority of those close to retiring are in Senior Staff positions and in Engineering roles, please see the table below:

- We looked at the employees that we can grow to become the next generation of leaders and engineers to create a mentorship program for eligible employees. 
- Unfortuently, HP only has little over 1.5K eligible employees- there will be a rush of hiring in the upcoming future

The analysis was performed via SQL code

The code for the analysis can be located:

## Summary

- HP needs to fill over 90K roles
- HP needs to seriously focus on recruiting to add more mentoring ready employees
- In order to evaluate the shortages, we need to see what departments and roles the mentorship-eligible employees work in - we need to pull additional queries to evaluate the gaps
- HP will also need to take a look at the the overall employee base to see what fraction of overall employees are retiring soon, to really understand the impact.
